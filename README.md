# Machine-Learning-Projects
A structured collection of my hands-on machine learning projects. These projects focus on solving real-world problems using data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and iterative improvement. The repository serves as a demonstration of practical machine learning skills using Python and popular ML libraries.
